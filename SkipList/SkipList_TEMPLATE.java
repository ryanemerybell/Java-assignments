// This is a basic template showing how to set up your Node and SkipList classes
// to be in the same file. For my test cases to work properly, you will need to
// implement your Node class here, in this file, outside of the SkipList class.
//
// Note: You will need to modify these class declarations to make your Node
// and SkipList containers generic and capable of holding any type of Comparable
// object.
//
// You should rename this file "SkipList.java" and remove this comment before
